$q. Implement the three algorithms and make sure to keep track of the number of
state expansions and the maximum size of the frontier. Report on the results and
compare the results of the different algorithms wrt.
- number of state expansions (time complexity)
- maximum size of the frontier (space complexity)
- quality (cost) of the found solution
- computation time (in seconds) for finding a solution.

Do these results support your previous assessment of the algorithms? Explain!
